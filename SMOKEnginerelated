# Script engine related, we want to know exctly how much garbage comes out of
# the exhaust. How many cylinders does it have, revolutions per sec, how many 
# strokes and so on. The amount of air that keeps enters the engine is what we
# want to know.... Improve is what we want! We are going to focus on diesel 
# engines. For now only focusing on 4 stroke engines and four cylinders!
# You can use and edit the code... With best purposes

#Air fuel/ratio - 14.5:1 (???) (14.5 parts of air to one of fuel)

# This was made for a diesel engine with that fuel/air ratio! There are others! As far as 
# i know! Diesel is still safer, it burns at higher temperatures, you can always try to add
# oxygen or hydrogen, depending on temperature... Either way... How do you decrease CO2 values? And other garbage?
